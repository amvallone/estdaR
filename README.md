# estdaR

This package contains a set of functions to perform exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis in R.

We have no intentions in the short run to upload the package to the CRAN. The package 'devtools' is required to install the package

```r{output="html"}
devtools::install_github("amvallone/estdaR")
```
The package is still on a development stage. Please, feel free to contribute to improving it. In case of errors, please, open a new issue.
